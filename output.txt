The following is the output from running OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on a parking sign in San Francisco from different libraries. Each of these libraries performs well in specific sections of the parking plate recognition. Your task is to consider the output from all 3 OCR models we use and combine it with your knowledge of how parking signs usually are written in the San Francisco area to understand what the parking sign they scanned said. On the basis of this and taking into account the current time in PDT time zone tell me whether I can park here or not at the time of making this query. In the case of missing information or information that obviously looks wrong use your own judgement

Remember the time to be considered for checking if parking is allowed is the Sun Apr  7 12:02:15 AM PDT 2024 in PDT.

Also the response has to be Either Yes or No in the last line based on your analysis and before a line break before the explanation.This is not a definite yes or no. Its your best judgement and if there is no information for the Sun Apr  7 12:02:15 AM PDT 2024 assume its allowed. This is understood by end users as well. Remember the first line of the response is just Yes or no without any spaces
Also an important detail to note is while you can use your existing knowledge to fill in gaps and make judgements on what is written on the parking plate you cannot assume anything about whats not written there. In short we refer to the parking plate as the ultimate source of truth and anything missing from overall present on te board is not to be assumed. For eg if the board mentions Mon Tues and Fri you assume there is no information about other days and so by default it should be okay to park. By default assume its okay to park and use the information from the board to restrict your understanding. Also give a brief description of how you reached this conclusion going through each ocr
