With reference to the three outputs from the OCR models, the most common and consistent elements suggest that there's a parking restriction for certain hours from Monday through Friday. Specifically, the parking is likely for "2 hours" or "9 hours" from "8 a.m. to 6 p.m.". Given the differences in the outputs, we'll take the more restrictive interpretation.

Additionally, there is an exception for vehicles with area permits. Based on the information available, there is no restriction mentioned for weekends or times outside the specified time frame on weekdays. This is relevant because your query time falls on a Sunday at 12:02:15 AM PDT 2024, which is outside of the specified restrictions.

Thus, based on the scanned parking sign, it should be okay to park at this time.
