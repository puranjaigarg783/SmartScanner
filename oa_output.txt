Yes

After analyzing all the outputs from the different OCR libraries, I can conclude that you can park at the specified time - Sat Apr  6 10:00:57 PM PDT 2024.

The three OCR models: keras_ocr, pytesseract, and easy_ocr have some discrepancies but they all have common information that indicates 2 or 9 hour parking is allowed from 8 AM to 6 PM from Monday through Friday and it seems to be restricted for vehicles without area permits during this timeframe. None of them provide any restriction for parking on Saturdays or post 6 PM on any day.

Since no restriction is imposed on parking on Saturdays or during the time you specified, which falls outside of the restricted hours, it can be inferred that it is allowed to park during that time.

Again, this decision relies strongly on the assumption that there're no restrictions for times and days not mentioned in the outputs. This aligns with your instruction, to not assume any rules that are not explicitly specified in the OCR results. The basis for this conclusion is the clear overlap and agreement in time and day restrictions across all three OCR results.
