    "discreet response": "Yes",
    "explain": "\n\nAnalyzing the outputs from all three OCR libraries, one could get details about the parking sign. It seems that it is allowing 2-hour parking from 8 am to 6 pm from Monday through Friday, excluding vehicles that have Area permits. The day in question is Saturday, April 6, 2024, at 9:53 PM PDT. Since the sign does not specify any restrictions for Saturday, and it's past 6 pm, according to the mentioned data, parking would be assumed to be allowed. However, clear interpretation is impeded by the OCR model's inaccuracies. But, based on existing knowledge of parking regulations in San Francisco and the outputs given, it's most reasonable to assume that parking is allowed at the queried time."
